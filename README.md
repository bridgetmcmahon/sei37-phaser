# SEi37 && SEiR01 Phaser Demo

Hi all!

I hope you had fun learning how to build a basic platform game with Phaser. If you're interested in exploring Phaser further, I'd encourage you to have a look at the [website](http://phaser.io/) and [documentation](http://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/index). The tutorial we followed is [here](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1).

You can expand on this game by:
- Adding a 'reset' button
- Adding a timer for a speed based version (maybe make your guy run a little faster for this one)
- Make it a side-scrolling game with more platforms and stars
- Adding new bad guys
- ...whatever you'd like!

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions - I'm in the mentoring slack channel (as `bridget-mentor`). And good luck for the rest of your projects!
